### Background

You work at a startup that is building a new and disruptive platform called Fintech Finder. Fintech Finder is an application that its customers can use to find fintech professionals from among a list of candidates, hire them, and pay them. As Fintech Finder’s lead developer, you have been tasked with integrating the Ethereum blockchain network into the application in order to enable your customers to instantly pay the fintech professionals whom they hire with cryptocurrency.

In this Challenge, you will complete the code that enables your customers to send cryptocurrency payments to fintech professionals. To develop the code and test it out, you will assume the perspective of a Fintech Finder customer who is using the application to find a fintech professional and pay them for their work.

# Results
Having provided my Ethereum wallet and account information, using the functions to pass to the application, a list of the Fintech professionals appears on the streamlit.  After assessing the candidate’s hourly rate, I have selected the Fintech professionals, calculating their wages based on my affordability.  As such, 4 blocks of payment transactions were signed and executed.
